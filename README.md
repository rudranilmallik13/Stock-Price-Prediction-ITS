# Stock Price Prediction

Welcome to the **BSE Sensex Forecasting Web App** — a deep learning-powered tool built with **Streamlit** and **LSTM Neural Networks** to predict the **next day's closing price** of India's stock market index: **Sensex**.

---

## Overview

Stock price prediction is a challenging problem due to the highly non-linear and dynamic nature of the financial markets. This project applies advanced **sequence modeling** with **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** to capture the temporal dependencies in historical BSE Sensex data.

The app allows users to:
- Fetch or upload Sensex data
- Preprocess and scale time series
- Train an LSTM-based model
- Visualize performance
- Predict the **next trading day’s closing price**

---

## Models Implemented

### 1. Basic LSTM
- A simple one-layer LSTM with a Dense output layer.
- Suitable for capturing short-term patterns.

### 2. Stacked LSTM with Dropout (Current Model)
- Two LSTM layers: (128 units → 64 units) with Dropout.
- Helps in reducing overfitting and learning deeper sequence patterns.
- Architecture:
  ```python
  model = Sequential()
  model.add(LSTM(128, return_sequences=True))
  model.add(Dropout(0.3))
  model.add(LSTM(64))
  model.add(Dropout(0.2))
  model.add(Dense(1))
  ```

### 3. Future Additions (Coming Soon)
- **GRU-based models**: for faster training
- **CNN-LSTM**: for capturing local and long-term dependencies
- **Attention-based LSTM**: for interpretability

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**
   - Downloaded using Yahoo Finance or uploaded manually
   - Normalized with `MinMaxScaler`
   - Transformed into supervised learning format using a sliding window

2. **Model Training**
   - LSTM network trained using a 60-day (Variable) lookback window
   - Dropout layers help reduce overfitting

3. **Prediction & Inverse Scaling**
   - Next day’s price is predicted and inverse-transformed for readability
   - RMSE and MAE are calculated to assess accuracy

---

## Sample Output

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| RMSE   | ~948 |
| MAE    | ~731  |
| Sensex Close | ~80,000 |

**Relative Error < 0.9%**, which is very strong for financial time series.
